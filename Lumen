An Introduction to the Lumen Project
Contents:
What content can I find in the database, and where does it come from?

Since its founding in 2001, the Lumen project (formerly the Chilling Effects Clearinghouse) has collected almost 11 million requests to remove material from the World Wide Web. Today, this archive is an indispensable resource for anyone seeking to understand the global ecosystem of requests to remove content from the Internet. The complaints in Lumen's database include DMCA takedown notices submitted to the database by the individual senders or recipients, as well as other types of requests or demands for removal, such as court orders received by Internet providers and hosts such as Google, Twitter, Medium, Wikipedia, Wordpress, DuckDuckGo, and others. Aggregating all of these different requests to remove material facilitates the research, study and mapping of the Internet's removal request landscape by journalists, NGOs, policy-makers, and academics.
Where do the notices come from?

Submissions to the Lumen database generally come from either the original recipients or the senders of the notice or removal request.

Businesses that receive removal requests (like Google, Twitter, Wordpress, and others), or that send such requests (like CounterfeitTech), have partnered with Lumen to automatically send us some or all of the removal requests they receive or send. For more information about these companies' submissions to Lumen, please refer to each company's own website and information pages.
A notice or work contains "[redacted]" – what is missing?

Lumen staff make a good faith effort to review and redact any potentially sensitive notices that the project receives in order to remove sensitive or personal information from the text of notices. Such information might include phone numbers, email addresses, or allegedly defamatory content. Further, an individual or company submitting a notice directly to the Lumen database may have decided not to share with Lumen, or to keep private, certain pieces of information in the notice. Finally, Lumen runs automated processes to remove certain sensitive information from notices and descriptions of their associated works where possible.

Please note that for DMCA notices, Lumen does not typically redact the name of the rightsholder making the request or the URL(s) of the material complained of. Without the location of the complained-of material and the complainant, the notices are meaningless from a transparency or research perspective, to say nothing of offering no insight as to possible misuse of takedown notices as a vehicle for censorship.

When a company shares copies of court orders it has received with us, Lumen typically displays those orders in the form in which they have been shared with Lumen and further, makes a good faith effort to do so in accordance with the applicable law of the jurisdiction from which the order emerged. United States court orders, unless sealed, are public documents.
Who is Lumen for?

Lumen is designed for casual use by lay Internet users curious about a notice they may have encountered, as well as for more in-depth and focused use by journalists, NGOs, policy-makers, and legal researchers studying larger trends about content removal online. If you are interested in conducting journalistic, academic, legal, or policy-focused research of your own on, or have further ideas about we might improve the database and its interfaces, email us at team@lumendatabase.org.
How does it work?

Most users will find that the web interface will suffice for browsing and discovery within the database. However, for those that need to access larger swaths of data for use or reuse in various applications, we offer our API. Read on for further information.
BASIC FACTS ABOUT THE DATABASE
Contents
API Documentation

The documentation for the Lumen API can be found here.
Formatting

When a query or request is submitted to the database, the system will return a response with a list of JSON-encoded attributes. Learn more about JSON (JavaScript Object/Open Notation) here. This format is designed to be “machine readable,” and not necessarily useful to a human reader in its raw form. However, there are many tools for rendering JSON output into a friendlier form, and we recommend finding one that works for you.
Example JSON Request:

<code>
curl https://lumendatabase.org/notices/1.json
</code>

Example Successful JSON Output:

<code>
{
  "dmca":{
    "id":1,
    "title":"Lion King on YouTube",
    "body":null,
    "date_sent":"2013-06-04T19:23:12Z",
    "date_received":"2013-06-05T20:31:44Z",
    "topics":[
      "Anticircumvention (DMCA)",
      "Bookmarks",
      "Lumen"
    ],
    "tags": [
      "tag_1",

          { "url": "https://www.example.com/infringing3" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

Understanding dates - Unix Timestamps

The Lumen database accepts dates in a variety of formats but always outputs dates in Unix Time, which is the number of seconds elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch. This can be quite confusing at first, and we recommend using a Unix Timestamp conversion tool (like this one here) to transform these raw date outputs into something a human can understand.
Searching the Database

Most users will find that the web interface will suffice for browsing and discovery within the database. However, for those that need to access larger swaths of data or create automated processes to digest data trends, we offer our new API.

Searching the database, whether through the web interface or with the API, is done via full-text search. The default search is to search all possible notice fields and facets. Searches can also refined based on specific slices of the database or on specific facets of the data. See the documentation for the applicable notice parameters and metadata.
QUERYING THE DATABASE WITH THE API
Contents
Getting an API Key
An authentication key is needed in order to query the database at will via the API. Contact the Lumen staff at team@lumendatabase.org to be provided with one. API queries to the database submitted without a token will be capped at the first 25 results, and at 5 requests per day.
Basic search from the command line

To query the database, use your preferred tools for HTTP "get" requests. There are a number of options available, so pick one depending on your research needs.
Examples include:

Example search query for Batman where <parameter> is the database field or facet that is the object of the search.

<code>
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" 'https://www.lumendatabase.org/notices/search?<b><parameter>=batman</b>'
</code>

Here’s a search query for star where term is the parameter.

<code>
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" 'https://www.lumendatabase.org/notices/search?<b>term=star</b>'

</code>

Searches can also combine multiple parameters when linked with an ampersand. Below, the query combines a search for star where term is the parameter, where batman is the sender_name, and date_received falls between RANGE1..RANGE2

<code>
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" 'https://www.lumendatabase.org/notices/search?<b>term=star&sender_name=batman&date_received=_facet=RANGE1..RANGE2</b>'
</code>

Running these search queries through the API will allow you to search for some period of time, as well as download search results for use and reuse in applications. A complete list of searchable parameters can be found here.
Requesting a List of Topics

The database classifies notices into one or more topics, more of which may be added over time. Certain topics are categorized as subtopics of a larger, comprehensive root topic. For example, like “DMCA,” “fair use,” and “anti-circumvention” all fall under “Copyright.” Each topic has a unique numerical ID in the database. To request a list of topics, use the following command.

<code>
 curl https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics.json
</code>

This command will return results with three pieces of information: 1) the topic's unique ID number, 2) the name of the topic, and 3) either the ID number of the parent topic or null if the topic is a root topic.
id 	integer 	The unique ID used for the topic_ids array during notice creation
name 	string 	The topic name
parent_id 	integer 	The parent topic_id of this topic, or "null" if this is a root topic.
Searching the notices

On the web interface, above a certain number of hits your search results will be paginated. By default, results are sorted by descending relevance. Full-text search results contain the same data as an individually-requested notices, with the addition of a score field that articulates the result relevance to the query term; higher numbers are more relevant. Terms are joined with an 'OR' by default.
Downloading Results in Bulk
In order to better manage its resources, Lumen limits requests to its API as well as use of the web-based user interface. For those interested in less restricted access to the database through the API, please see "Getting an API key."
